REQUIREMENTS
------------

To install Cotonti for the first time,
you'll need to have the minimum following server software pre-installed:

* WWW Server (Apache, nginx, etc)
* PHP 5.1 or higher
* MySQL 4.1 or higher


SERVER CONFIGURATION
--------------------

You MUST ensure that PHP has been compiled with support for:
* GD
* Mbstring
* MySQL
* PCRE
* Sessions
* Zlib
in order to successfully run Cotonti.


OPTIONAL COMPONENTS
-------------------

If you want support for SEF (Search Engine Friendly) URLs,
you'll need mod_rewrite and the ability to use local .htaccess files.


INSTALLATION
------------

1. Download the latest Cotonti distribution from the Cotonti website.
   http://www.cotonti.com

2. Unpack the downloaded file on your computer.

3. Open config-simple.php with any text editor of your choice,
   the file is located in the /datas directory.

4. Update the config-simple.php file with the values you have recieved from your
   HSP (Hosting Service Provider). The data that needs to be updated is:

$cfg['mysqlhost']
* Database host URL. If no host is received from your HSP, leave it to
  localhost.

$cfg['mysqluser']
* Database user name, as provided by your host

$cfg['mysqlpassword']
* Database user password

$cfg['mysqldb']
* Database name. The database must exist before you run Cotonti for the first
  time.

$cfg['mainurl']
* Site URL. Set this to your site URL. Examples: 'http://your_site.com',
  'http://www.your_site/subfolder'.

5. After update rename config-simple.php to config.php

6. Connect your FTP software to your site,
   and start uploading the Cotonti distribution to your root directory.
   You do not need to upload the /sql directory,
   since it only contains documentation and database creation scripts.
   Make sure you upload to the right directory. Most HSPs' web directory is /,
   but a few might have /html, /htdocs or /home as the web root directory.
   This should however be mentioned in the information received from your HSP.
   If nothing is mentioned, you assume it is /.

7. There are a number of catalogs that you need to change the write access to (CHMOD).
   This can easily be performed trough your FTP software.
   The directories that needs to be changed is:

/datas/cache/ (and all its subfolders)
/datas/defaultav/
/datas/avatars/
/datas/photos/
/datas/signatures/
/datas/thumbs/
/datas/tmp/
/datas/users/

   You can change the rights by right clicking on the catalogue name and select properties.
   Then you get the following screen, and can change the rights to 0777.

8. If you want to use a custom skin for your site, you can get it from
   http://www.cotonti.com/downloads/skins/ or elsewhere. Then you need to put
   it to the /skins folder of your site.

   The next step is to update your config.php:

$cfg['defaultskin']
* This should point to your skins's name. It's the name of the directory in
  /skins folder.

$cfg['defaulttheme']
* This should point to your skin's main CSS file. Usually it is the same as
  skin's name or 'style'. For more information about themes, visit
  http://www.cotonti.com/docs/en/skins/theme_support_in_skins

date_default_timezone_set('GMT');
* This should contain your prefered timezone instead of GMT. You can find the list
  of valid timezones on http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php

8. After uploading, we need to create the SQL database that Cotonti is using.
   Connect with phpMyAdmin or similar to your site,
   using the username and password received from your Hosting Service Provider.

9. Select Import from the menu when you are logged in.

10. Browse and select the cotonti-install.sql file located under /sql.
    Then press GO to create the Cotonti database.

11. Now the database is created and your Cotonti distribution is uploaded.
    Time to access the site.
    Direct your browser to your site,
    and you should see your new Cotonti homepage.

12. The final task is for you to register to the site.
    The first register that registers automatically becomes admin,
    so register straight away by selecting "Register" in the menu,
    and fill out your information. After registration is completed,
    log in to your new site.

13. Congratulations! Your site is now up and running.
